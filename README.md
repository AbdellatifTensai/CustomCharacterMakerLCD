crude gui to make custom characters for a character LCD display

it basically makes 8 section with 5 by 8 checkboxes to indicates pixels in a character LCD display and then send the data through serial by jSSC library to an arduino to drive the display.

this is the datasheet for the display i was using: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/HD44780.pdf
